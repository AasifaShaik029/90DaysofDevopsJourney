When you first create a deployment, it triggers a rollout, a new rollout creates a new deployment.

# Understanding Updates and Rollbacks in Kubernetes Deployments

## Introduction

Kubernetes deployments provide a mechanism to manage application updates and rollbacks effectively. This document explains key concepts, strategies, and commands related to rollouts, updates, and rollbacks in a clear and detailed manner.

## Key Concepts

1\. Rollouts and Versions:  
   - A rollout occurs when a deployment is created or updated. Each rollout creates a deployment revision, enabling tracking of changes and rollbacks.

2\. Deployment Strategies:  
   - Recreate Strategy: Stops all old versions and starts the new ones, causing downtime.  
   - Rolling Update Strategy (default): Gradually replaces old versions with new ones, ensuring application availability.

## Commands and Their Usage

### Creating a Deployment

Starts a new deployment.

Command:

kubectl create -f &lt;deployment-file.yaml&gt;

Example:

kubectl create -f my-deployment.yaml

### Check Rollout Status

Shows the progress of a deployment rollout.

Command:

kubectl rollout status deployment/&lt;deployment-name&gt;

Example:

kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app

### View Rollout History

Lists all revisions of a deployment, showing changes made.

Command:

kubectl rollout history deployment/&lt;deployment-name&gt;

Example:

kubectl rollout history deployment/my-app

### Update the Deployment (Using Apply)

Apply changes from a new YAML file.

Command:

kubectl apply -f &lt;updated-deployment-file.yaml&gt;

Example:

kubectl apply -f updated-deployment.yaml

### Update the Deployment (Using Set Image)

Set a new container image directly.

Command:

kubectl set image deployment/&lt;deployment-name&gt; &lt;container-name&gt;=&lt;new-image&gt;

Example:

kubectl set image deployment/my-app my-container=my-image:v2

### Rollback the Deployment

Reverts to the previous version of the deployment.

Command:

kubectl rollout undo deployment/&lt;deployment-name&gt;

Example:

kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app

### Inspect Deployment Details

Provides detailed information about the deployment.

Command:

kubectl describe deployment/&lt;deployment-name&gt;

Example:

kubectl describe deployment/my-app

### List Replica Sets

Shows all replica sets for the deployment.

Command:

kubectl get replicasets

Example:

kubectl get replicasets

### Delete a Deployment

Removes the deployment entirely.

Command:

kubectl delete deployment/&lt;deployment-name&gt;

Example:

kubectl delete deployment/my-app

## Deployment Lifecycle and Flow

1\. Deployment Creation:  
   - Trigger rollout → Create ReplicaSet → Scale Pods.

2\. Update Process:  
   - Modify configuration → Apply changes → Create new ReplicaSet → Rolling update.

3\. Rollback:  
   - Undo rollout → Scale down current ReplicaSet → Scale up previous ReplicaSet.

| **Aspect** | **kubectl set** | **kubectl apply (Update)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Used for **imperative changes** (quick updates) | Used for **declarative updates** (updates the configuration in YAML files) |
| **Use Case** | Quick, temporary changes like updating image, replicas, etc. | Updating the resource definition, keeping it in sync with the YAML file |
| **Changes to YAML** | **Does not modify** the local YAML file. Updates are applied directly to the running resources. | **Modifies** the YAML file (if you update the file locally) and applies changes to the cluster. |
| **Version Control** | **Not tracked** in source control. Only affects live resources. | **Tracked** in source control as part of the YAML file. |
| **When to Use** | When you need a **quick** update or when working in a **testing** or **development** environment. | When you need to manage changes **declaratively**, track them over time, and maintain configuration in source control. |
| **Examples of Changes** | Changing container image, scaling replicas, setting environment variables directly in the cluster. | Modifying container image, replicas, or any other setting in the YAML file and applying the update using kubectl apply. |
| **Reusability** | Updates are **not stored** in YAML files, so it is not easy to reapply the same changes later. | The updated configuration is **stored** in YAML files, making it easy to apply changes across environments. |
| **Consistency Across Clusters** | Changes are applied to the current cluster only; they need to be manually replicated elsewhere. | Changes are part of version-controlled YAML files, which can be applied across multiple clusters for consistency. |
| **Automation/Scripting** | Ideal for use in scripts and automated processes where the local file does not need to be modified. | Better for managing configuration as code, especially in a CI/CD pipeline or a multi-cluster environment. |
| **Example Command** | kubectl set image deployment/my-app my-container=my-app:v2 | kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml (after editing the YAML file) |
