### Performance to EFS

* **Max I/O performance mode** is used to scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second.
    
* **General Purpose performance mode**: Suitable for most applications and workloads that don't require the high throughput and IOPS that Max I/O offers.
    
* **Bursting Throughput**: Ideal for workloads with occasional high throughput requirements, leveraging burst credits for better performance.
    

### AWS Secrets Manager

* Helps protect secrets needed to access applications, services, and IT resources.
    
* **Rotation**: Enables easy rotation, management, and retrieval of database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle.
    
* **Integration**: Works seamlessly with other AWS services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon Redshift, for managing database credentials.
    

### Hibernate

* To minimize the application bootstrap time whenever the system needs to be stopped and then started at a later point in time.
    
* **Instance State**: The Amazon EBS root volume is restored to its previous state, RAM contents are reloaded, and processes are resumed.
    
* **Data Volumes**: Previously attached data volumes are reattached, and the instance retains its instance ID.
    

### Kinesis Data Firehose

* The easiest way to reliably load streaming data into data lakes, data stores, and analytics tools.
    
* **Capture and Transform**: Can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk.
    
* **Real-time Analytics**: Enables near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards.
    

### Reserved vs Spot Instances

* **Reserved Instances**: Suitable for workloads with predictable usage, providing cost savings in exchange for a commitment.
    
* **Spot Instances**: Ideal for flexible workloads that can tolerate interruptions, providing significant cost savings for non-essential or batch jobs.
    
* **Use Case**: For 70 instances that need to be always available, use Reserved Instances; for 30 instances responsible for batch jobs, use Spot Instances.
    

### Aurora Multi-Master Cluster

* In a multi-master cluster, all DB instances can perform write operations.
    
* **Continuous Availability**: Avoids failover, as another writer DB instance is immediately available if one fails.
    
* **Use Case**: Useful for applications where you can't afford even brief downtime for database write operations.
    

### AWS Storage Gateway

* A hybrid cloud storage service that provides on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage.

* **RDS Read Replicas**: Provide enhanced performance and durability, but do not automatically scale storage for the primary database.
    
* **Data Transfer Charges**: There are charges for replicating data across AWS Regions.
    
* **Aurora Multi-AZ**: Enhances availability and durability but does not help in read scaling.
    

### AWS Config and ACM

* **AWS Config**: Provides AWS-managed rules for evaluating compliance with best practices.
    
* **ACM Certificates**: AWS Config can check if ACM certificates are expiring soon. ACM automatically renews its own certificates but does not renew imported ones.
    

### AWS Lambda

* Can be combined with DynamoDB to process and capture key-value data from IoT sources.
    
* **Timeout**: Lambda functions timeout after 15 minutes and are not ideal for long-running jobs.
    
* **Scalability**: Automatically scales with the number of events to process.
    

### Amazon S3

* **Static Website Hosting**: Amazon S3 can host static websites with individual web pages containing static content.

* **Client-Side Encryption**: Encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to S3.
    

### VPC Endpoint

* Allows private connection between VPC and supported AWS services without requiring an Internet gateway or NAT device.
    
* **Private Connectivity**: Ensures secure communication between instances in your VPC and AWS services.
    

### Amazon Cognito

* **User Pools**: Manage authentication, sign-up, sign-in, and user profiles.

* **Instance Replacement**: Maintains target capacity by launching replacement instances after Spot Instances are terminated.
    

### Dedicated Instances vs Dedicated Hosts

* **Dedicated Instances**: Physical isolation without server control, cost-effective and simpler.
    
* **Dedicated Hosts**: Physical isolation with server control, required for specific licensing and compliance needs.
    

### VPC Peering Connection

* **Direct Connection**: Connects two VPCs directly using private IP addresses, suitable for connecting a small number of VPCs.

### Spot Instances

* **Cost-Effective**: Provides unused EC2 instances at lower prices than On-Demand.
    
* **Spot Blocks**: Designed not to be interrupted for a set period.
    
* **Persistent Requests**: Automatically reopens after interruptions or instance stops.
    

### ElastiCache

* **Read-Heavy Workloads**: Improves latency and throughput for read-heavy application workloads.
    
* **Write-Heavy Workloads**: Not ideal, as cache can become stale quickly.
